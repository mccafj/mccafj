### Hi there 👋, I'm Jon

I am a Data Scientist and a Physical Therapist with 15 years experience in a variety of settings. 
I'm a curious and creative person who enjoys problem-solving, as well as teaching and helping others to achieve their best.

So far, I have utilized Python and Jupyter Notebooks, with a variety of libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Surprise, as well as using GitHub, Object-Oriented Programming, and SQL.

I am:
- adept at exploratory data analysis, finding patterns & trends
- fluent in Pandas dataframe tasks and data wrangling
- able to build data visualizations in Matplotlib and Seaborn
- well-versed in classification models, including creating pipelines, performing GridSearch, and evaluating with appropriate metrics
- able to complete model-based collaborative-filtering and content-based filtering to create a recommendation system
- and I completed a fall detection system for older adults, using XGBoost

🔭 I’m currently learning / working on ...
- additional SQL training
- Tableau Public dashboards
- finding a job 🙂
